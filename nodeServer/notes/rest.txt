Rest principles

main
---
Uniform Interface. 
Clear defined API Endpoints qith clearly defined requests
+ response structure. It should be predictable.

Stateless interaction. 
Client and server dont store any connection history,
every request is handled separately.

secondary
---
Cacheable. 
server may set cache headers to allow the client to cache responses

Client-server. 
Client and server are separated, client is not connected 
with persistent data storage.

Layered system
Sever may foward requests to other APIs 

Code on demand
Executable code may be transferred from server to client
