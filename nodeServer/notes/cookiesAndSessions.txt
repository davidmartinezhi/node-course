Cookie:
User interacts with our views (front end)
from inside that view if user sends a request we send a response with cookies
cookie is only important to store information from the browser for the user
cookies are stored on the client side

With cookies we can store data in the browser of a single user, to personalize the experience

Explaining Cookies to a 5-Year-Old:
Imagine you have a favorite toy store you always go to, and every time you visit, 
the store owner remembers your name and what toys you like. How do they remember? 
Well, imagine each time you visit, you give them a special card that has your name 
and favorite toys written on it. 
The next time you come back, you show them the card, and they say, 
"Oh, I remember you! You like these toys!" That's kind of what cookies do on the internet. 
When you visit a website, the website gives your computer a little reminder note (a "cookie"), 
so next time you visit, the website can remember things about you, like what you like to see on the website!

Explaining Cookies to a 10-Year-Old:
You know how when you play a game or use an app on the internet, and it remembers your 
progress or what you did last time you were there? That's because of something called cookies. 
Think of cookies like tiny notes or stickers that a website leaves on your computer or tablet. 
These notes are safe and only the website that gave you the note can see what's written on it. 
They can have information like your username, the pages you visited on the site, or even what you 
put in a shopping cart if you're buying something online. So, next time you go back to that site, 
it can read its own note and remember things about you to make your visit more personal, like keeping 
you logged in or showing you things you might like. It's a way for websites to make your experience 
better and more customized to you!

Storing data in client side is interesting, but sensitive data should not be stored in cookies. 
since user can manipulate it, for that we can use sessions.

Cookies are a popular instrument for tracking customers

Cookie can also be sent to another page. tracking pixel
google can track on which page we are and how we move through the web to find this


Configuring cookies:
We can set more thing that just valus in key value pairs
we can add more keyvalue pairs such as res.setHeader("Set-Cookie", "loggedIn=true;Max-Age=10")

Max-Age, is how much can a cookie survive in seconds. this is applied in banks where authentication expires
Domain=,to where cookie should be sent
Secure, page will only be sent through https page
HttpOnly, now we cant access cookie value through client side javascript

Often we will use packages to set cookies.


# Sessions
Sessions help us storing sensitive information across requests

Information is stored in backend on a session. It is not stored in request nor variable in express app
We only want to share info across all request from the same user

We store it in memory, but then a session storage. A client needs to tell the server to which session it belongs

We will use cookie to store id of session. change id will not work, because value will be hashed and server can
confirm we have not fidle with it.

Session stored on server side and we utilize cookie to save hashed id of which session belongs to that user

Express session helps manage sessions
Sessions should be stored in database, connect-mongodb-session helps to do this and we store session in database

User Info we dont want to lose after every response and that should not be visible to other users
