Explaining Cookies to a 5-Year-Old:
Imagine you have a favorite toy store you always go to, and every time you visit, 
the store owner remembers your name and what toys you like. How do they remember? 
Well, imagine each time you visit, you give them a special card that has your name 
and favorite toys written on it. 
The next time you come back, you show them the card, and they say, 
"Oh, I remember you! You like these toys!" That's kind of what cookies do on the internet. 
When you visit a website, the website gives your computer a little reminder note (a "cookie"), 
so next time you visit, the website can remember things about you, like what you like to see on the website!

Explaining Cookies to a 10-Year-Old:
You know how when you play a game or use an app on the internet, and it remembers your 
progress or what you did last time you were there? That's because of something called cookies. 
Think of cookies like tiny notes or stickers that a website leaves on your computer or tablet. 
These notes are safe and only the website that gave you the note can see what's written on it. 
They can have information like your username, the pages you visited on the site, or even what you 
put in a shopping cart if you're buying something online. So, next time you go back to that site, 
it can read its own note and remember things about you to make your visit more personal, like keeping 
you logged in or showing you things you might like. It's a way for websites to make your experience 
better and more customized to you!
